# Overview
- This project aims to apply Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy to solve real-world problems. 
- The submission will follow specific guidelines to ensure clarity, functionality, and ethical considerations.

## Submission Guidelines
### 1. Code
- Provide well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks.
- Ensure functionality and efficiency.
- Submit all code on GitHub.

### 2. Report (PDF)
- Answer theoretical questions concisely.
- Include screenshots of model outputs (accuracy graphs, NER results, etc.).
- Provide an ethical reflection.
- Share the PDF as an article in the Community, Peer Group Review, and include it in the GitHub Repo.

### 3. Presentation
- Create a 3-minute video explaining your approach.
- Ensure all members participate.
- Share the video on the Community platform.

## Grading Rubric
### Criteria	(Weight)
- Theoretical Accuracy	(30%)
- Code Functionality & Quality	40%
- Ethical Analysis	15%
- Creativity & Presentation	15%

## Tools & Resources

## Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
## Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
- Dataset: Iris Species Dataset 
### Goal:
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode labels).
- Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall. 

### Deliverable:
- Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

## Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits 

### Goal:
- Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.
- Achieve >95% test accuracy.
- Visualize model predictions on 5 sample images. 

### Deliverable:
- Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

## Task 3: NLP with spaCy
- Text Data: Amazon Product Reviews 

### Goal:
- Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.
- Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach. 

### Deliverable:
- Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.

## Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)
### 1. Ethical Considerations
- Identify potential biases in MNIST or Amazon Reviews models.
- Discuss ways tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCyâ€™s rule-based systems mitigate biases.

### 2. Troubleshooting Challenge
- Debug and fix errors in a TensorFlow script (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions).

### Bonus Task (Extra 10%)
- Deploy your model using Streamlit or Flask.
- Submit a screenshot and a live demo.

## How to Submit
- 1. Upload all code (Jupyter notebooks/scripts) on GitHub.
- 2. Submit the report (PDF) as an article and in the GitHub repo.
- 3. Record and share the presentation video.
