# Overview
- This repository contains the practical submission for Group 43â€™s Week 3 assignment, focusing on the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to real-world datasets. The implementation leverages popular Python libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy. The goal is to develop solutions, analyze results, and reflect on the ethical implications of AI models.
